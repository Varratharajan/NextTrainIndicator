Next Train Indicator

The NTI display will work within a virtual timeframe (VT) that is faster than real time (RT): 1 minute (VT) = 1 second (RT).  
The NTI display should be able to display all expected train information for the next 15 VT mins.  
The NTI display should list each expected train on a separate line and should indicate: 
The order the trains will arrive 
The destination of each train 
The amount of minutes before each train arrives  
The NTI display should only be tall enough to list at most two expected trains at a time  
The NTI display should not be interactive but it should always display up to date information, if required paging should be done automatically  
The NTI display should display the current VT below the list of expected trains  
The NTI display will begin at 05:00 VT and continue infinitely.
